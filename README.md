* Predatory Loan Prevention/Consumer Protection: Develop a website with the Harvard Legal Services Center that helps scam victims of for-profit Corinthian Colleges determine whether and how they qualify for a settlement.
* Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) Sealing: Develop an app that helps criminal offenders and their lawyers in Massachusetts more easily navigate the process of sealing their criminal record, which can dramatically affect employment and educational opportunities.
* Intake Project: Work with the Mental Health Legal Aid Committee (MHLAC) to develop more efficient ways to schedule appointments and reminders with MHLACâ€™s clients, who are facing both legal issues and mental health concerns. 
* U Visa: Develop a system that allows Greater Boston Legal Services (GBLS) to more efficiently manage the collection of affidavits from Spanish-speaking immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, who are domestic violence victims. These affidavits form part of an application for a U Visa, which gives victims the right to live and work in the U.S.
* Legal Calculators for Public Defenders and Clients: Work with the Massachusetts Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS) to develop a tool that helps public defenders and their accused clients better understand the consequences of different convictions.
